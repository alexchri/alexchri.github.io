I actually began as a "talented" (more on that later) mathematics student. I had really enjoyed my studies in high school, and my first year of college I was motivated to begin my illustrious career in mathematics. 
Long story short, I crashed early and hard. 

At the time I wandered in my academics looking for a fresh start. And luckily I wandered into a expo fair for final projects in an intro to computer science class at my university. I saw websites, videogames, robots, and course schedulers that students had built. I had the chance to interact and ask questions about these products - and I fell in love. I had just caught a spark for programming. I then quickly enrolled in my first course. I loved the class and pursued the material with a passion. So why did my early college career fail? I reflected later on that I had not established the foundation of why mathematics. I was good at math, but I wasn't in love with it! My passion for programming is what continued encouraging me to work those late nights and discuss those emerging technologies like a excited kid.

Since then, I have been refining my craft for the past few years, constantly looking for more schools of thought to better my knowledge bank in programming. I look forward to leaving my coding fingerprints on technologies we haven't imagined today.
